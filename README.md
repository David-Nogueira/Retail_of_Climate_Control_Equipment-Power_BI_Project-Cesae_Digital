<p align="justify">
This project was developed as part of the <strong>Data Analyst course at CESAE Digital</strong>, aiming to consolidate knowledge in Power BI through data analysis and visualization.<br>
The proposed challenge involved analysing the <strong>sales performance of climate control equipment</strong> for a major retailer, combining internal data, such as sales volume and operational costs, with external data, such as climate conditions and purchasing power by region.<br>
Throughout the project, techniques for data injection, transformation, and combination were applied, along with the creation of measures to support data analysis and interpretation. The final goal was to understand which factors most influence sales success across different locations.<br>
The original report was written in <strong>European Portuguese</strong>, as was the <strong>Power BI project</strong>, where table names, columns, and measures were kept in the original language. However, for portfolio purposes, the <strong>report</strong> has been <strong>restructured and translated into English</strong>.

<p align="justify">
A major home appliances retailer aims to analyse the performance of its stores in the sale of climate control equipment, cross-referencing this data with contextual factors such as regional climate conditions and purchasing power.<br>
The goal of the analysis is to determine whether more extreme weather conditions favor the sale of items in certain locations or if purchasing power and population size are the primary factors influencing sales success or failure.

<strong>Influence of Climatic Conditions on Sales by Region:</strong>
  <ul align="justify">
  <li><ins>Maximum Night Temperature</ins>:</li>
  The region with the highest average sales is Alentejo, which has the second-lowest night temperature (10,4 ºC). However, the second and third regions with the highest 
  average sales are Madeira and the Azores, which have the highest night temperature values (16,9 ºC for Madeira and 15,6 ºC for the Azores). Therefore, it is concluded 
  that the maximum night temperature does not influence sales volume, as the temperature difference between the first and second regions with the highest average sales 
  exceeds 6ºC.
  </ul>
</p>

<p align="justify">
  <ul align="justify">
  <li><ins>Maximum Daytime Temperature</ins>:</li>
  The two regions with the highest sales volume are Alentejo and Madeira, which also have the highest daytime temperatures (23,5ºC in Alentejo and 22,5ºC in Madeira).<br>
  Even considering that the third region with the highest average sales volume, the Azores, has the second lowest daytime temperature, the data from Alentejo and Madeira 
  suggest that the higher the maximum daytime temperature, the greater the sales volume.<br>
  It is observed that the best-selling equipment in Alentejo is the Split Air Conditioner, which makes sense given that it is the region with the highest maximum daytime 
  temperature. In Madeira, the best-selling equipment is fans, which is also logical as Madeira has the second highest maximum daytime temperature.
  </ul>
</p>

</p>

<p align="justify">
  <ul align="justify">
  <li><ins>Humidity</ins>:</li>
  As previously observed, the region with the highest average sales volume is Alentejo, followed by Madeira. It is verified that these are the regions with the lowest 
  humidity percentages (Alentejo has 70% humidity and Madeira 71% humidity).<br>
  Even considering that the third region with the highest average sales volume is the Azores, which has the highest humidity percentage. Based on the data from Alentejo and 
  Madeira, it is observed that the lower the humidity percentage, the higher the sales volume.<br>
  It is noted that the second most-sold equipment in Alentejo is dehumidifiers, which does not make sense as it is the region with the lowest percentage. Furthermore, 
  Alentejo is the region with the highest average sales of dehumidifiers, despite being the region with the lowest humidity percentage.
  </ul>

<p align="justify">
  <ul align="justify">
  <li><ins>Rainy Days and Precipitation</ins>:</li>
  The regions with the lowest number of rainy days and precipitation are Algarve, Alentejo, and Madeira. Given that the latter two are the regions with the highest average    sales volume, it is verified that the fewer the rainy days and the lower the precipitation, the higher the average sales volume. Even considering that the third region      with the highest average sales volume is the Azores, which has the highest number of rainy days and the highest precipitation value.<br>
  It is verified that there is no influence of rainy days and precipitation on the type of equipment sold. This is because Madeira, despite having low precipitation values    and rainy days, has a high average value of heat pump sales, and Alentejo, despite having low values of rainy days and precipitation, shows high average sales values for    fireplaces, stoves, and dehumidifiers.
  </ul>

<p align="justify">
  <ul align="justify">
  <li><ins>Sunlight Hours</ins>:</li>
  The region with the fewest sunlight hours is the Azores, with 1971 hours, and the region with the most sunlight hours is the Algarve, which has 3212 hours. The 
  referenced regions are not the ones with the highest average sales volumes. However, since the Algarve has the highest sunlight hours and the lowest average sales 
  values, it can be concluded that the more sunlight hours there are, the lower the average sales volume.<br>
  Regarding the influence of the number of sunlight hours on the average sales of each type of equipment, it is not conclusive. This is because the Algarve, despite having 
  the highest number of hours, has a heating device as the best-selling equipment, namely fireplaces and stoves. However, in the Azores, which has the fewest sunlight 
  hours, the best-selling equipment is multi-split air conditioners, which makes sense due to the lack of sunlight.

<p align="justify">
<strong>Influence of Purchasing Power on Sales by Region:</strong><br>
The purchasing power reference is the national average (100). When analysing the data, it is verified that the only region with above-average purchasing power is the Lisbon region. However, it is not the region with the highest average sales volume.<br>
Thus, higher purchasing power does not necessarily mean a higher average sales volume. However, looking at the data from the regions with the lowest purchasing power, which are Madeira (87,20%) and the Azores (87,40%), it is verified that these regions are the second and third highest in average sales volume. Therefore, this further reinforces the conclusion that higher purchasing power is not related to a higher average sales volume.

</p>

<p align="justify">
<strong>Influence of Resident Population on Sales by Region:</strong><br>
When analysing the data, it is verified that the region with the highest resident population is the North. However, it is not the region with the highest average sales volume. However, the North having the highest resident population justifies being the region with the highest number of stores (22) and consequently, as expected, having the highest total sales.
It is important to highlight that for parameter comparisons between regions, average sales values were used, as it would not make sense to use total sales values when the number of stores per region is not equal.
Analysing the regions with the lowest resident population, which are Madeira and the Azores, and relating the fact that these same regions are the second and third with the highest average sales value, it further reinforces the conclusion that a higher resident population does not mean a higher average sales volume.

</a>

<p align="justify">
To apply this scale/measurement to other variables, the following procedure should be followed:
</p>

<ul align="justify">
<li>Select the variable of interest for analysis (e.g., fixed cost per store).</li><br><br>
  
<li>Calculate the total average of the variable – this corresponds to the index 100 (e.g., average fixed costs per store).</li><br><br>

<li>Perform a simple rule of three (example for fixed costs):<br>
Average fixed costs ↔ 100%<br>
Fixed costs of the store ↔ X<br>
X = (Fixed costs of the store * 100) / Average fixed costs
</li><br><br>

<li>Draw conclusions, considering that values below 100% are below the average and vice versa. Therefore, the further the percentage value is from 100%, the greater the deviation. In this example, a store with fixed costs above 100% will need to reduce expenses, while a store below the average value has greater financial flexibility in terms of fixed costs.</li>

<p align="justify">
This question is essential for understanding the popularity and commercial success of games on the Steam platform over time. Identifying the best-selling game can provide valuable insights into player preferences and market trends. Additionally, this information can be useful for game developers and investors when assessing the profit potential of new projects.<br>
Since my dataset does not have a "sales" column, I analyzed the maximum number of owners, as each player had to acquire the game. However, some games are free (price = 0) but still highly profitable due to in-game transactions. Therefore, I divided this question into two analyses: one excluding free games and another including them.

<p align="justify">
<strong>The best-selling game, excluding free games, is New World</strong>, with a total of <strong>one hundred million</strong> (100,000,000) players. By consulting the auxiliary table, it was found that the app_id corresponds to an MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) game, <strong>where players cooperate but also compete against each other</strong> (PVP), and <strong>in-game transactions with real money are possible</strong>.<br>
<strong>The price of $39.99 falls within the expected range</strong>, as most games from well-known developers have a launch price of $69.99 for franchises already popular among players.<br>
<strong>Player feedback</strong> for this game <strong>is mostly positive</strong> (154,914) compared to negative (73,900). After researching on Steam, it was found that the reason for <strong>the negative feedback was due to in-game transactions disrupting the balance of player-versus-player fights</strong> <sup>[1]</sup>.

<strong>The game is free</strong> but includes in-game transactions and as <strong>it is a game from 2013, it already has a well-established community that pays for exclusive in-game content</strong>.<br>
<strong>Player feedback</strong> for this game <strong>is overwhelmingly positive</strong> (1,477,153) compared to negative (300,437).

<p align="justify">
Knowing which game has the highest price on the Steam platform is important to understand the price range of games available.

<p align="justify">
<strong>The highest price on the Steam platform is $299.9, and it belongs to Artform Curvy 3D 3.0</strong>. Consulting the supporting table, the app_id corresponds to single-player games. As a result, I researched and found that <strong>it is not a game but a sculpting program for 3D artists</strong>. It is evident that this software has been around for over 10 years (<strong>since 2013</strong>), yet it has few users (max_owners=20,000). <strong>The feedback is mostly positive</strong> but small in volume (32 positive, 13 negative).

<strong>The game with the most positive feedback is Dota 2</strong>, with nearly one and a half million positive reviews. Dota 2 has already been mentioned in this project, as it also has the largest number of users (max_owners). This overwhelmingly positive feedback is due to it being a game with over 10 years of existence, during which it has built a strong community.

<p align="justify">
<strong>Note</strong>: During the data cleaning process, two factors (minimum number of users and time to complete the game) were removed due to being incomplete and irrelevant for the analyses to be conducted.<br><br>
To gain an overview of the data, I created a table and a correlation chart using the "square" method:
</p>

By analyzing the table and the data correlation chart:
</p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
  <li><strong>The release date (release_date) and game categories (app_id)</strong> show the highest correlation of 0.904, within a range of 0 to 1.</li>
  <li><strong>The maximum number of users (max_owners) and positive feedback (positive)</strong> show a correlation of 0.826.</li>
  <li><strong>Negative feedback (negative) and positive feedback (positive)</strong> show a correlation of 0.714.</li>

</a>

<p align="justify">
This question is crucial for understanding the main drivers behind game sales on the Steam platform. By analyzing various factors such as price, user reviews, release date, game genre, among others, it is possible to identify which of these factors have the greatest impact on sales. This can help developers, publishers, and investors make strategic decisions, such as setting appropriate prices, planning marketing campaigns, and guiding the development of new games.<br><br>
<strong>Note</strong>: The dataset does not contain a sales column. To estimate sales, the maximum number of users (max_owners) was used, as these players had to acquire the games to play them.<br><br>
For the analysis of the factors that most affect game sales, the fields with the highest correlation to the max_owners field were examined using a correlation table, and the best subsets were identified through a graphical representation.
</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="justify">
Using the table and the graph, it is observed that the fields with <strong>the highest correlation to the max_owners field are positive and negative feedback</strong>. Therefore, the factors that may influence this feedback will be analyzed later. Additionally, <strong>other fields of some importance include the release date (release_date) and the price (price)</strong>.<br><br>
The reasons for the high correlation between positive feedback and the number of users, followed by the correlation with negative feedback, are as follows:
</p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>Game Quality</strong>: Games that receive positive player reception tend to attract more users. If a game is well-received by the gaming community due to its gameplay, graphics, storyline, or other elements, it is more likely to draw a larger user base.</li>
<li><strong>Recommendations and Reviews</strong>: Players often make purchasing decisions based on reviews and recommendations from other players. If a game receives positive feedback, it is more likely to attract new users who trust these reviews.</li>
<li><strong>User Retention</strong>: Players often make purchasing decisions based on reviews and recommendations from other players. If a game receives positive feedback, it is more likely to attract new users who trust these reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Buzz Marketing (Word of Mouth)</strong>: Players often make purchasing decisions based on reviews and recommendations from other players. If a game receives positive feedback, it is more likely to attract new users who trust these reviews.</li>

While there is a correlation between positive feedback and the number of users, other factors not included in the analysis may also influence the user base. Additionally, the correlation between negative feedback and the number of users may indicate that games with low negative feedback also tend to attract more users (as observed in the decision tree, where 78% of users choose a game when it has low negative feedback).

This question aims to understand the key factors that influence users' positive feedback on a game. By analyzing a combination of factors such as price, user ratings, game genre, game duration, and others, it is possible to determine which characteristics lead to more positive feedback. This can be valuable for game developers, guiding the development process to create games that meet players' expectations and preferences, resulting in better reception and market success.<br>
For the analysis of the factors that contribute to predicting whether a game will receive positive feedback, the fields with the highest correlation to the "positive" variable were examined using a correlation table.

This correlation table once again confirms the previously observed information, showing that positive feedback has a strong correlation with the <strong>max_owners</strong> field and negative feedback. The next most relevant factor is <strong>price</strong>.<br><br>
Following this, a predictive model was built, which resulted in an R² value of:
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/125d0a79-e58e-4e16-a5f3-90759be56396" width="50%">
</p>

<p align="justify">
A <strong>coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.754</strong> indicates that approximately <strong>75.4% of the variability</strong> in the response variable (<strong>positive feedback</strong>) can be explained by the model. This means that the model can capture and explaining a significant portion of the observed variability in players' positive feedback regarding games.<br>
An R² of 0.754 is considered quite high and suggests that the model has a reasonably strong ability to predict positive feedback based on the given data. This can be interpreted as an indication that the factors considered in the model (such as negative feedback, price, etc.) have a strong relationship with players' positive feedback.<br>
However, it is important to emphasize that <strong>R² alone does not determine the validity or quality of the model</strong>. Therefore, it is always crucial to conduct a more in-depth analysis, including the evaluation of other model performance metrics and the consideration of potential limitations in the data and modeling.<br><br>
To support this evaluation, I created a <strong>table and a scatter plot</strong> comparing the predicted values to the actual values:
</p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
  <li><strong>Table with actual values:</strong></li>
</ul>

</p>

<p align="justify">
By comparing the predicted <strong>positive feedback</strong> values with the actual values in the original dataset, it is evident that the values are <strong>close</strong>. The <strong>minimum</strong> value for both the actual and predicted feedback is <strong>0</strong>. The <strong>maximum actual</strong> positive feedback value is <strong>1477153</strong>, while the <strong>predicted maximum</strong> is <strong>1171197</strong>, resulting in a difference of 305956 between the actual and predicted maximum values. The <strong>average actual</strong> value is <strong>1046</strong>, whereas the <strong>predicted average</strong> is <strong>1058</strong>.<br><br>
By analyzing the scatter plot, it is evident that the predicted values and actual values are close. However, some values are more dispersed and not as condensed.<br><br>
<strong>Therefore, this model is good for predicting positive feedback for games, considering only that the maximum predicted value may not be as close to the actual value, tending to be lower than the real value.</strong><br><br>
It is concluded that <strong>a game will receive positive feedback if</strong>:
</p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>It has many players</strong>, as the game will receive more positive feedback. This happens if the game becomes popular, and users are satisfied with the overall gaming experience.</li>
<li><strong>It receives less negative feedback</strong>, suggesting an inverse relationship between user satisfaction and negative reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Its price meets expectations</strong>. Higher-priced games may be perceived as offering greater value and, therefore, receive more positive feedback, provided they meet user expectations.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
With this R programming project on Steam platform games from 2013 to 2023, it was possible to gain valuable insights into the behavior of both games and users. The selected questions for analysis were fundamental in understanding various aspects of the online gaming market.<br><br>
We began by identifying the best-selling game over the years, considering both paid and free games. Then, we determined the highest-priced games on the platform and identified the game with the most positive feedback, which allowed us to better understand player preferences.<br><br>
One of the most important analyses was identifying the factors that most affect a game's sales. By exploring the correlation between different variables, such as positive feedback, negative feedback, price, and others, we were able to identify significant patterns that influence a game's commercial success on the platform.
An additional question raised was whether, based on a set of factors, it would be possible to predict whether a game would receive positive feedback.<br><br>
Despite the challenges encountered, such as the need for prior dataset cleaning (over 60,000 records cleaned and normalized in Excel, Power BI, and R) and the selection of appropriate models, including the use of rpart for decision tree construction instead of C50 and the analysis of R² and scatter plots (without using the ROC model) to assess the quality of the prediction model, we managed to reach relevant conclusions.<br><br>
In conclusion, this project provided a comprehensive view of the Steam gaming market, demonstrating the importance of data analysis in understanding and decision-making in the digital entertainment sector. The findings and methodologies employed in this project can serve as a foundation for future analyses and for improving game development and commercialization strategies on the platform.
